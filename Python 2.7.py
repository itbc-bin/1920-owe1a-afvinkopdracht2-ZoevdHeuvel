#Boek opdracht 2.7, Miles per Gallon
#Use the formula "MPG=Miles driven/Gallons of gas used"
#Write a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas used.
#Then calculate the MPG and display the result

Miles_driven = int(input("How many miles did you drive?"))
Gallons_gas = int(input("How many gallons of gas did you use?"))

#Calculate the MPG
MPG = Miles_driven / Gallons_gas
print(MPG)
