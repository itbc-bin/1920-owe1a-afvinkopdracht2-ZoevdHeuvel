#Formula is Distance=SpeedxTime
#A car is traveling 70 miles per hour

#Calculate the distance the car will travel in 6 hours
Speed = 70
Time = 6
Distance1 = Speed*Time
print(Distance1)

#Calculate the distance the car will travel in 10 hours
Speed = 70
Time = 10
Distance2 = Speed*Time
print(Distance2)

#Calculate the distance the car will travel in 15 hours
Speed = 70
Time = 15
Distance3 = Speed*Time
